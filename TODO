- Change Data structure to an AoA with a seperate hash with column names for keys
  and references to array columns.  This way we can have the AoA and HoA without
  duplicating effort.  Also create a "tablespace" hash of tablenames for keys
  and a pointers to HoAs.
- Make a Reader for MDB files, using Win32::OLE investigate a cross platform option.
- Make a Writer for CSV and TSV(one file per table), 
- Make a Writer for ANSI SQL(CREATE TABLE and INSERT 
  INTO statements)
- Make a Reader and a Writer for ODBC
- Make all data sets plural, multiple text files(tsv, csv), multiple spreadsheets, 
  muiltiple tables (MDB, ODBC)
